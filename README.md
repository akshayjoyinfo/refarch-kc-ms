# Voyages and Fleet Simulation Solution Microservices

We recommend reading the content of this project documentation in [this book format](https://ibm-cloud-architecture.github.io/refarch-kc-ms/).

## Sub repositories

* The `fleet-ms` folder contains the Java App developed using microprofile and deployed on Open Liberty. It uses Kafka API to produce events. See [the readme for details](./fleet-ms/README.md) about deployment and code explanations.
* The `voyages-ms` folder contains the Node.js app for the voyages microservice also created with microprofile. It uses the Kafka API to produce events when an order has been assigned to a voyage.
